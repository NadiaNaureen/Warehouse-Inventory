# Warehouse-Inventory

Warehouse Inventory has been my first project using Data Strutures.
Queues has been used in the project because of it's FIFO property.

The scope of the given problem is to create a simple program for managing a warehouse inventory of televisions and fridges. The program should allow users to perform the following tasks:

1.	Display all available televisions and fridges in the inventory, along with their corresponding dates of arrival.
2.	Add new televisions or fridges to the inventory by providing their names and arrival dates.
3.	Buy televisions or fridges from the inventory and remove them from the list.
4.	Provide a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the program, continuously prompting for their choices until they choose to exit.

The program achieves this functionality through various functions:

•	enqueue1 and enqueue2: Adds names of televisions and fridges to the inventory.
•	enqueue_date1 and enqueue_date2: Add arrival dates for televisions and fridges.
•	display1: Display the list of televisions or fridges along with their corresponding dates.
•	add: Prompt the user to add a television or a fridge to the inventory.
•	dequeue_buy: Remove a television or a fridge from the inventory when a purchase is made.

Overall, the scope of the problem is to create an inventory management system for a warehouse that deals with televisions and fridges.
